## SLOW LORIS

Slow loris is a type of a Denial of Service attack. It makes an efficent use of the system so as not to hurt the user system and also constantly attack the given url. Slow Loris's result can be best seen when a web is hosted using tom cat service. So i advice you to use a local tomcat host a simple site such as a php or java and use this program to see the effect.

### Command
```python
python main.py localhost:8080/somesite.php
```
